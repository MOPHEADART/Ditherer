# Ditherer
Ditherer is a python program I wrote that applies a dithering effect to images. It accepts *.png, *.jpg, and *.jpeg formatting.
---
### Current features of Ditherer:
- Downscale image up to 12 times
- 2x2 Bayer Matrix
- 4x4 Bayer Matrix
- 8x8 Bayer Matrix
- Grayscale output
- Color output
- A preview window with live updates
---
This is my first python script I have written, expect janky code and improper formatting. Of course, any critiques, recommendation, or feedback is greatly appreciated!
> There are more plans for ditherer in the future, stay tuned for updates!
